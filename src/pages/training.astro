      <h2 class="text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-12 text-center">pilot license</h2>
      <p class="text-zinc-200 text-lg leading-relaxed text-center mb-8">
        In Canada, pilot licensing follows a structured progression with different levels to suit various aviation goals. The McGill Flying Club's flowchart explains this pathway, starting with the Private Pilot License (PPL) which allows you to fly solo or carry passengers. For those aiming for a professional flying career, the next step is the Commercial Pilot License (CPL). Pilots can then add advanced qualifications like the Instrument Rating (INRAT) for flying in poor visibility, the Multi-Engine Rating for operating complex aircraft, and the Instructor's Rating (AIRAF/AIRAT) to teach new pilots. Each license level requires both classroom learning and practical flight training. The flowchart provides a clear visual guide to help you understand and plan your aviation training journey from beginner to advanced levels.

      </div>
          <p class="text-zinc-200 text-lg leading-relaxed text-center mb-8">
          To earn your Private Pilot License (PPL), you'll need to complete both theoretical and practical components. Transport Canada requires <strong>45 hours of ground school instruction</strong> covering aviation theory, regulations, and navigation, plus <strong>45 hours of flight training</strong> including dual instruction with a certified flight instructor and solo flight time. This comprehensive approach ensures you develop both the knowledge and skills needed to safely operate an aircraft.

          <p class="text-zinc-200 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mb-2">
            Ground school is the theoretical/classroom component of your flight training. You must complete both ground school and practical flying to earn your license; much like a written and road test for a driver's license. Your first ground school will likely be for the PPL, including prep for the Student Pilot Permit, PSTAR, and PPAER. Once you complete the materials and 5h of flight instruction time, you'll get a recommendation for the written exams.

            <p class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-200 mb-2 text-justify">
              Flight training is the hands-on, practical component of becoming a pilot. While ground school teaches you the theory, flight training puts you in the cockpit where you learn to actually fly an aircraft. This includes learning aircraft controls, takeoffs and landings, navigation, emergency procedures, and developing the skills and confidence needed to safely operate an aircraft. Flight training is conducted with certified flight instructors in real aircraft, providing you with the practical experience required to earn your pilot license.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-2 px-8">practical training</h3>
            <p class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-200 mb-2 text-justify">
              Canadian Law dictates a <strong>minimum of 45 hours of flight training</strong>. On average, students require <strong>30 hours of dual flight</strong>, and <strong>15 hours of solo flight</strong>. You will have to carry out a <strong>cross country flight with your instructor</strong>, as well as <strong>5 hours of instrument training</strong>. Part of your solo training will include <strong>5 hours of cross-country flight</strong>, flying in a triangle of at least <strong>150 nautical miles</strong>, plus <strong>2 full-stop landings</strong>.

            <p class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-200 mb-2 text-justify">
              You must pass the <strong>Transport Canada Theory exam</strong> with a grade of at least <strong>60%</strong>. Also note that the theory exam is broken into 4 categories, and you must obtain at least <strong>60% in each one</strong> in order to pass. For example, you can't get 0 in one section, perfect in all the others, and claim victory, given a 75% average. The four sections of the exam will cover <strong>General Knowledge, Air Law, Navigation, and Weather</strong>. Then, you need to pass a <strong>practical exam with a Transport Canada representative</strong>, by getting a mark of at least <strong>60%</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-200 mb-2 text-justify">
              This licence permits you to be the <strong>Pilot In Command (PIC)</strong> of any <strong>single engine aircraft</strong> while in <strong>VFR day conditions</strong>. You may <strong>carry passengers, share expenses, fly abroad</strong>, and possibly go get a high performance aircraft rating.

            <p class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-200 mb-2 text-justify">
              The <strong>Private Pilot License</strong> allows its holder to fly as pilot or co-pilot of an airplane for personal purposes. This is the <strong>most commonly held license in Canada</strong> and is the first one earned by the aspiring professional pilot.
            </p>
            <p class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-200 mb-8">
              Only <strong>day flying</strong> of a <strong>single engine non-high-performance airplane</strong> in accordance with <strong>Visual Flying Rules (VFR)</strong> is allowed with the PPL, unless other ratings have been earned. Although a pilot with this license <strong>cannot work for hire</strong>, reimbursement for some costs is permitted.
